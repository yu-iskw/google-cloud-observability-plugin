# Sub-Agent Delegation Patterns

## Effective Delegation

- Delegate well-scoped, independently verifiable tasks.
- Define expected output format and completion criteria.
- Keep handoff contracts explicit to avoid overlap.

## Anti-Patterns

- Delegating ambiguous tasks with no acceptance criteria.
- Sharing ownership between multiple agents for one file without boundaries.
