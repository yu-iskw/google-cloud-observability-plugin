# Progressive Disclosure For Skills

Use `SKILL.md` as a concise entrypoint and link to detail files.

## Pattern

- Keep workflow short in `SKILL.md`.
- Link references for policy/semantics.
- Link scripts for checks/automation.
- Link templates/examples for scaffolding.

This keeps invocation lightweight while preserving depth on demand.
