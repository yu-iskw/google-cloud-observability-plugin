# Skill Invocation Guidance

## Trigger Design

- Describe clear trigger conditions in the description.
- Keep scope narrow to avoid overlap with unrelated skills.
- Add cross-links when handoff to another skill is expected.

## Naming Guidance

- Prefer names that describe implementation action (`implement-*`, `verify-*`).
- Avoid ambiguous names that hide component boundaries.
