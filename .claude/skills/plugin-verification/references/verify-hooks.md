# Verify Hooks

1. Validate hooks JSON shape and version.
2. Confirm matcher/event coverage against intended flows.
3. Smoke-test executable hook scripts.
4. Validate plugin-level load behavior.

Use:

- `../implement-hooks/scripts/validate-hooks.sh`
- `../implement-hooks/scripts/test-hook-script.sh`
