# When To Use Each Extension

## Decision Guide

- Need event-triggered automation: use hooks.
- Need reusable execution guidance: use agent skills.
- Need specialized delegated role: use sub-agents.
- Need coordinated parallel execution: use agent teams.
- Need shareable package with metadata/wiring: use plugin packaging.

Combine types only when a single type cannot satisfy requirements.
